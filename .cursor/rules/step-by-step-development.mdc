# Step-by-Step Development Workflow

## MANDATORY PROCESS:
1. **Complete ONE subtask at a time** from the README.md checklist
2. **STOP after each completed task** 
3. **Mark the checkbox** in README.md (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
4. **Explain what was accomplished** before moving to the next task:
   - What was done
   - What files were created/modified
   - What was learned or discovered
   - Any challenges encountered
   - Next steps

## Rules:
- Never skip the explanation step
- Always update the README.md progress tracking
- One subtask per iteration - no rushing ahead
- Document lessons learned and decisions made
- Commit changes after each major milestone

## Example Flow:
1. ✅ Complete subtask (e.g., "Install AWS CLI")
2. ✅ Update README.md checkbox
3. ✅ Explain: "Installed AWS CLI v2.x, configured with credentials, tested with `aws s3 ls`"
4. ✅ Move to next subtask

This ensures thorough understanding and creates a clear development trail for interview discussions.
